### About Me ###  


### Nested Movies ###  
Nested Movies is a movie app that displays the most popular movies on iTunes with the option to tap on each movie for more information about it. The app fetches JSON data from Apple RSS and is built with Swift and uses King Fisher Library for image loading.

### Tip Calculator ###  

Tip Calculator is one of the first apps I built. The app takes an amount and gives back a percentage of it. The app is built with Swift and Lottie Library for animations.
